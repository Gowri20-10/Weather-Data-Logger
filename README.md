The Weather Data Logger is a simple, interactive web application designed to display real-time weather information based on user input. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project allows users to enter geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) and retrieve live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. When the user clicks the "Get Weather Data" button, the app validates the inputs and sends a request to the API. If the input is valid, the application fetches and displays the current temperature (in Celsius), a brief description of the weather (like clear, cloudy, rainy), and the name of the place corresponding to the entered coordinates. The front-end is styled with a weather-themed background and a modern, transparent black container that makes the content visually appealing. Input validation ensures users receive clear prompts if required fields are empty. Overall, this project demonstrates how APIs can be integrated into a responsive front-end interface to create useful, real-time applications, making it a great beginner-level project to understand JavaScript, API handling, and basic web design.
